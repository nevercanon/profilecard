## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

### Screenshot

I will provide screenshots of the project in my GitHub repository.

### Links

- Live Site URL: (https://nevercanon.github.io/profilecard/)

## My process

I used mobile-first workflow and vanilla HTML and CSS to complete this project. I'm not yet comfortable with using frameworks, since I want to feel confident in my vanilla skills before attempting them. This project was fairly straightforward.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I feel like the biggest thing I learned was about positioning the background images. For one thing, I learned that you can have multiple background images. But I was so thoroughly confused about how to position them. Once I felt like I had the circles in a good spot, they moved from it as soon as the screen size changed. I actually had to look up a YouTube tutorial of the project just for this part of it. I had had no idea how to position background images, let alone that you can use vw and vh for that purpose. It worked so well to make this page responsive! I'm definitely going to need to practice with these more.

I also learned more about positioning with the profile picture. I was briefly confused with how I was going to stick the picture between two divs, but realized I had learned about positioning a couple of days ago. I did have to look up which position properties I wanted to use (since I find it so hard to remember) but thankfully I figured it out pretty easily.

### Continued development

This project was an easier one for me, maybe the easiest since I started doing the Frontend Mentor challenges. I take that as a sign that I'm improving, and it's very encouraging. I'm going to try a few more Newbie challenges to make sure I'm feeling really solid and ready to take on the next level. I know I need to work on positioning my elements. That's been a consistently confusing topic for me, but I know it's going to be an important one.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.svgviewer.dev/) - This helped me view the SVG files. I was having a really hard time visualizing what they were supposed to look like without being able to view them in VS Code.
- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - This is the article I used to understand how to use multiple background images at once, and the format for linking them, positioning them, and setting the background-repeat property.
- [Resource 3](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-position.php) - This is the article I used to better understand background positioning.
- [Resource 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZpG9EBKYWc&t=1263s) - This is the video I watched walking through the project so that I could understand how to position the background images.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank Mr. Coder on YouTube, for making a video of his process working on this project. It was amazingly beneficial in helping me understand positioning concepts.
